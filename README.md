# Text Classification & Recommendation System  

## Overview  
This project focuses on **text classification and recommendation systems** using various machine learning models. It involves **data cleaning, feature extraction, model training, and recommendation system evaluation** to improve user experience through **personalized recommendations**.

## Features  
- **Text Classification**  
  - Preprocessing and feature extraction using Count Vectorizer & TF-IDF  
  - Training models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
  - Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization  
- **Recommendation System**  
  - User-User and Item-Item collaborative filtering  
  - RMSE-based evaluation for selecting the best approach  
  - Sentiment analysis for improving recommendations  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy**  
- **Text Processing:** NLTK, spaCy  
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- **Google Colab for execution**  

## Installation  
Install the required dependencies:  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost nltk spacy matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

## Usage  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and feature extraction  
- **Model Training:** Train text classification models and tune hyperparameters  
- **Recommendation System:** Implement collaborative filtering and evaluate performance  
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Enhance recommendations using sentiment scores  

## Results  
- The **User-User recommendation system** was found to be more effective due to lower RMSE.  
- **XGBoost** performed well for text classification.
